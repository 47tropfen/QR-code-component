## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

Set height in the body on 100vH was the most powerful learning because I used to use 100% before. 


### Continued development

I'm still at the beginning of learning HTML and CSS. So the first thing I want to develop is to remember most of all elements, tags and when using them. This is the reason i decided to join Frontend Mentor. Just looking videos is not the best practical exercise.


### Useful resources

I'm learning on Udemy. There I always can get back and look for the right manual or thing I need for the beginning.
